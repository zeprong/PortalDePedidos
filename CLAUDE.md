### Analysis Summary

# Codebase Analysis Report: Graphics Usage

This report analyzes the usage of graphics within the `Front_END` directory, specifically addressing why two graphics might be present. The analysis focuses on identifying where image assets are referenced and rendered.

## High-Level Overview

The `Front_END` application is a React-based web application. Graphics are primarily used for branding (logos) and potentially for visual elements within components. The assets are stored in the [assets directory](d:/programa/Proyectos/SanMiguel/Front_END/src/assets/).

## Graphics Usage Analysis

The presence of multiple image files in the [assets directory](d:/programa/Proyectos/SanMiguel/Front_END/src/assets/) suggests that different graphics are used for various purposes within the application. Specifically, the files found are:

*   [Bc.png](d:/programa/Proyectos/SanMiguel/Front_END/src/assets/Bc.png)
*   [logo.png](d:/programa/Proyectos/SanMiguel/Front_END/src/assets/logo.png)
*   [react.svg](d:/programa/Proyectos/SanMiguel/Front_END/src/assets/react.svg)
*   [sm logo.png](d:/programa/Proyectos/SanMiguel/Front_END/src/assets/sm%20logo.png)
*   [tex.png](d:/programa/Proyectos/SanMiguel/Front_END/src/assets/tex.png)

To determine why "two graphics" are present, we need to examine the frontend components that render images. Common components that might display logos or other visual elements include the main application entry point, headers, or login pages.

### Potential Locations for Graphic Rendering

1.  **Main Application Entry Point:** The [main.jsx](d:/programa/Proyectos/SanMiguel/Front_END/src/main.jsx) file is the entry point for the React application. It typically renders the root component, which might include a logo.
2.  **Login Page:** The [Login.jsx](d:/programa/Proyectos/SanMiguel/Front_END/src/Login.jsx) component is a likely candidate for displaying a company logo or branding.
3.  **Header Component:** The [Header.jsx](d:/programa/Proyectos/SanMiguel/Front_END/src/Component/Header.jsx) component, if present, often includes a logo for navigation or branding purposes.
4.  **App Component:** The [App.jsx](d:/programa/Proyectos/SanMiguel/Front_END/src/App.jsx) component is the main application component and could directly or indirectly render graphics.

Without further information on which "two graphics" the user is referring to, a detailed analysis of each of these files would be required to pinpoint the exact usage of each image asset and explain why two specific graphics are being displayed. It is common for applications to use multiple graphics for different contexts, such as a main logo, a smaller favicon, or specific icons for UI elements.
